# CodeWolf AI
A Code Review AI tool to help elevate your code for best practices!

Welcome to **CodeWolf AI** - an innovative platform designed to enhance your coding experience through artificial intelligence. This project is still in its early stages, with exciting developments like a VS Code extension on the horizon.

## Overview

CodeWolf AI leverages advanced AI to analyze code, providing developers with insights, suggestions, and potential bug identifications. Here's what you need to know:

### Features

- **Automated Code Review**: Get instant feedback on your code submissions.
- **Error Detection**: AI algorithms detect common programming errors and potential bugs.
- **Code Optimization**: Suggestions for optimizing code for performance and readability.
- **Style Compliance**: Checks if the code adheres to popular style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google's style guides).
- **Learning Tool**: Ideal for beginners to learn best practices and for professionals to maintain code quality.

### Getting Started

#### Installation

Currently, CodeWolf AI operates through a web-based interface. Here's how to get started:

1. **Visit the Website**: Navigate to our platform at "PLACE HOLDER"
2. **Sign Up**: Create an account or log in if you already have one.
3. **Upload or Paste Code**: Use the interface to submit your code for review.

#### Future VS Code Extension

- **Installation**: Once released, you'll be able to install the extension directly from the VS Code Marketplace.
- **Usage**: Use the extension to review code directly within your VS Code environment, no need to switch between applications.

### How It Works

1. **Code Submission**: You submit your code through our platform or, in the future, via the VS Code extension.
2. **AI Analysis**: Our AI examines the code for various parameters like efficiency, style, and potential errors.
3. **Review Report**: Receive a detailed report with feedback, suggestions, and ratings.
